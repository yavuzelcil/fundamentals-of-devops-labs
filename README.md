Hands-on DevOps labs from the book 'Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery'. Includes local, Render PaaS, and AWS EC2 deployments.

## Notes

### IaaS/PaaS

> There are two main cloud offerings: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), which gives you access to low-level computing resources (servers, hard drives, networks), and leaves it up to you to put them together into a software delivery process, and platform as a service (PaaS), which gives you access to higher-level primitives, including an opinionated software delivery process. To get a feel for the difference, you'll use a PaaS in the next section and an IaaS in the section after that.

### Virtual Private Server

> Some companies primarily focus on giving you access to a virtual private server (VPS) for as cheap as possible. These companies might offer a few other features (e.g., networking, storage) as well, but the main reason you'd go with one of these providers is that you just want a replacement for having to rack your own servers, and you prefer to have someone else do it for you and give you access. Some of the big players in this space include Hetzner.

### Cloud Providers

> Finally, a handful of large companies are trying to provide general-purpose cloud solutions that offer everything: VPS, CDN, containers, serverless, data storage, file storage, machine learning, natural language processing, edge computing, and more. The big players in this space include AWS, Google.

> In general, the VPS and CDN providers are specialists in their respective areas, so in those areas, they will typically beat a general-purpose cloud provider in terms of features, pricing, and user experience. For example, a VPS from Hetzner is usually faster, cheaper, and in some ways easier to use than one from AWS.
